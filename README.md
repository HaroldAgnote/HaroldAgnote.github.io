Since our groups BeachHacks 2017 Project turned out to be a bust, I decided to build my own personal website instead since it's a project that I've been meaning to do for a long while now. 



I mainly used PHP to build the site and its features and I'm using a Database to easily updated my news feed and projects.


Overall, I'm glad with the way it turned out, and I'm planning on deploying it live on a server soon, so standby for that!
